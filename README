# Environment Configuartions
1.Conf Directory
    ./conf/EnvConfig CONF_PATH
    Specify the absolute path of the conf directory. I didn't use python to auto-detect this path
    because the conf directory will be packed into a zip file for the usage of spark-submit, which
    will cause the auto-detected path to point to a .zip package rather than the origin directory
2.Tool Directory
    ./conf/EnvConfig TOOL_PATH
    The absolute path the the mentioned tool directory.

# Untouchable Files
